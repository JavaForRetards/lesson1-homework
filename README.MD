# Lesson 1: Setup and Hello World
This lesson covered the very basics. The homework for next time is as follows:
1. Configure Git & SSH
2. Create project
3. Write code that prints the following, splitting every word into a separate statement:
```
Hello, my name is 
yourname
```
4. Push the results on GitHub (remember to grant me access if you make it private).
5. Link me the repo (duh).
